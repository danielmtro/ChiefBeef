Major Project implementation for a turtlebot within a grocery store. This 
bot will be able to traverse the store using SLAM to localise itself and 
use it's camera to keep a record of stock. A GUI will be used to see the 
current inventory and control the robot.

# How to setup the Physical Turtlebot
1) Turn the Turtlebot on and power up
2) Wait for it to make the sound and for the green light on the second top level to turn on (this is WIFI)
3) Connect to the wifi `eb542147pi`
4) `ssh ubuntu@10.42.0.1` in the terminal to take over the terminal of the bot
5) run `selfTest` to check the turtlebot functionality
